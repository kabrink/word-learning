Data analysis for Word Learning study

"Word Learning" is a study that assesses whether children will selectively trust a robot that provides accurate information compared to a robot that provides inaccurate information. Children watch two robots name a series of familiar objects, where one robot always names the object correctly and the other robot always incorrectly names the object.
